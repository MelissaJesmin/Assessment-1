// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
//In order:
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis_of_requirements = "This is the second step, in which they discuss with the users every requirement needed in the product. The developers will analyze and check to see all the requirements needed such as the hardware/OS and if it is possible to complete these requirements."

const design = "This is the third step, in which developers will come up with how to design the product such as the UI, how it looks, how to implement the requirements"

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers will take the design they made and create it using code. This can be broken down into smaller tasks."

const testing_integration = "This is the fifth step, in which developers test the code to check for errors and fixing the bugs/errors"

const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers keep track of the performance of the product such as checking the software, user reviews, bugs"
